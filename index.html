        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>Page Visibility API</cite> defines a means to
        programmatically determine the [=Document/visibility state=] of a
        top-level browsing context, and to be notified if the
        [=Document/visibility state=] changes. Without knowing the
        [=Document/visibility state=] of a page, web developers have been
        designing web pages as if they are always [=Document/visible=]. This
        not only results in higher machine resource utilization, but it
        prevents web developers from making runtime decisions based on whether
        the web page is [=Document/visible=] to the user. Designing web pages
        with knowledge of the document's [=Document/visibility state=] can
        result in improved user experiences and power efficient sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this API, web applications can choose to alter their behavior
        based on whether they are [=Document/visible=] to the user or not. For
        example, this API can be used to scale back work when the page is no
        longer [=Document/visible=].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>
        Examples of usage
      </h2>
      <p>
        To improve the user experience and optimize CPU and power efficiency
        the application could autoplay a video when the application is
        [=Document/visible=], and automatically pause the playback when the
        application is [=Document/hidden=]:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="Visibility-aware video playback">
      const videoElement = document.getElementById("videoElement");

      // Autoplay the video if application is visible
      if (document.visibilityState === "visible") {
        videoElement.play();
      }

      // Handle page visibility change events
      function visibilityListener() {
        switch(document.visibilityState) {
          case "hidden":
            videoElement.pause();
            break;
          case "visible":
            videoElement.play();
            break;
        }
      }

      document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", visibilityListener);
      </pre>
      <p>
        Similar logic can be applied to intelligently pause and resume, or
        throttle, execution of application code such as animation loops,
        analytics, and other types of processing. By combining the
        {{Document/visibilityState}} attribute of the {{Document}} interface
        and the `"visibilitychange"` event, the application is able to both
        query and listen to page visibility events to deliver a better user
        experience, as well as improve efficiency and performance of its
        execution.

        The <cite>Page Visibility API</cite> enables developers to know when a

        {{Window}} object already provide a mechanism to detect when the
        {{Document}} is the active document; the [=Window/unload=] event
        provides a notification that the page is being unloaded.
